# GxAirCom

GxAircom aims to be a complete and open source implementation of the [FANET+ (Fanet + Flarm) protocol](https://github.com/3s1d/fanet-stm32/blob/master/Src/fanet/radio/protocol.txt) running on readily available cheap lora modules and interfacing with mobile phones via Bluetooth. It can also act as a Fanet ground station and broadcast recieved FANET information to [OGN](http://wiki.glidernet.org).

For information and documentation see:

- [The PDF quick guide](doc/20200908%20-%20GXAirCom%20-%20Quick%20Guide.pdf) and the [The PDF Documentation](doc/20200723%20-%20GXAirCom%20-%20A%20LoRa%20communication%20device%20for%20free%20flying.pdf)

This fork has:
- a new board type Heltec_Lora_Airmodule
used for Heltec Lora V2.1 as irmodule, as Heltec Lora lacks a GPS module, an external GPS needed
- added Airmode for Heltec Lora V3
used for Heltec Lora V3 as airmodule, as Heltec Lora lacks a GPS module, an external GPS needed
- changed batch files for creating header files and compressed versions of html pages

Similar/ related projects are:

- The [SoftRF](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF) project, which has wider hardware and protocol support, but implements only the subset of the FANET protocol that broadcasts and receives locations. It also cannot broadcast FANET and FLARM at the same time.
- The [Skytraxx FANET Source](https://github.com/3s1d/fanet-stm32). The original reference implementation of the FANET standard and upstream of the standard protocol specification and documentation.
